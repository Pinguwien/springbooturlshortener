springbooturlshortener
======================

Just a small URL Shortener created with Spring Boot out of boredom. Few lines of code, definitely not production-ready, but does what it should (if you have a short domain, for sure).

Technologies used: Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Gradle, jQuery, Redis, Html
